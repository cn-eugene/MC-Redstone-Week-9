# MC-Redstone-Week-9
Hello ninjas and families,

Here are the saved folders from the Minecraft Redstone Camp -- They have the name of each ninja in camp; Inside are zipped folders with their worlds that will need to be downloaded. Depending on the version of Minecraft and set of instructions for the version (Java or Bedrock), they will need to be unzipped. Down below, is information with how to access the worlds if you have Minecraft (either Java or Bedrock). The first set of instructions are for if you want to open the world in Java Edition (meaning you have it for computers or laptops). The second set of instructions are for if you want to open it in Bedrock (which can be played with on computers or laptops), but is more known as the Nintendo Switch version of Minecraft. 

The slide show presentations titled: Redstone Creation and TnT Cannon Instructions are for the ninjas to use if they would like to make any of the Redstone creations. (Kael -- our intern for this summer -- created these slide show presentations.

***Note: For Minecraft, you must have Microsoft account to log in. Minecraft is not free, it costs $30 for Java and Bedrock. The Minecraft launcher is free (which is all that is needed for Bedrock Edition; If you have an account on the Switch, you log in with the Switch account and you can convert it from Java to Bedrock for free).***

# Here are instructions to open the saved world in Java edition: 
1.) Sign in to Minecraft with Microsoft (or create account): https://www.minecraft.net/en-us 

2.) download Minecraft Launcher 

3.) download Minecraft world file (zipped) from Github link that is sent out (remember where this downloaded file was saved) 

3.) unzip folder and place it into these file paths: 

**%appdata%\\.minecraft\saves** - (for windows); **~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves** - (for mac)
*you can find these file locations using: (finder or search -- for mac), (Windows Key + R -- for Windows)*

4.) Open Minecraft Launcher 

5.) Hit Play on Java Edition  

6.) Open single player and it should be there 


# Here are the instructions to convert the Java world to Bedrock, and be able to use it on the Nintendo Switch:
1.) Sign in (or create account) to Minecraft (**make sure it is the same account that is used on the Nintendo Switch**): https://www.minecraft.net/en-us  

2.) download Minecraft Launcher 

3.) download Minecraft world file (zipped) from Github link that is sent out (remember where this downloaded file was saved) 

4.) https://chunker.app/  (open this link) 

5.) upload arhive (and select the zipped version) 

6.) follow website instructions (pick version—we’d want bedrock—do the latest version for BEDROCK specifically) 

7.) download the file Chunker gives you (gives bedrock world file--.mcworld; it might take a while and do not close browser while uploading) 

8.) open Minecraft launcher and launch Bedrock Edition from the launcher 

9.) hit play (Bedrock edition should be open) 

10.) click on the arrow next to the create world button 

11.) it will bring up file window and select the world file that was downloaded from chunker (.mcworld) 

12.) logout of minecraft 

13.) uninstall minecraft (if you do not want to keep it) 

***notes: it should be available on the linked Nintendo Switch Account, however it might not sync*** 


# If needed, Here are the instructions to convert from Bedrock back to Java:

1.) Same process as above except go into bedrock 

2.) in Bedrock edition: Edit world (general tab and scroll all the way to bottom) 

3.) Export world and it exports to .mcworld 

4.) Upload the .mcworld to chunker website (upload archive part) 

5.) Gives zip file  

6.) unzip the zipped file/folder that chunker provides into the .minecraft\saves file:

**%appdata%\\.minecraft\saves** - (for windows); **~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves** - (for mac)
*you can find these file locations using: (finder or search -- for mac), (Windows Key + R -- for Windows)*
 

***(the opposite as above--opposite from converting Java to Bedrock)***
